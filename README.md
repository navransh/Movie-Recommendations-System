Cinephile - Content-Based Movie Recommendation System

Overview

Cinephile is a content-based movie recommendation system that leverages cosine similarity to suggest movies to users based on the characteristics of the movies they have previously enjoyed. The system analyzes movie metadata, including genres, keywords, cast, crew, and plot summaries, to find the most similar movies to a given title. The main goal of Cinephile is to help users discover new movies that match their tastes and preferences.

Features

Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies based on the similarity of genre features, keywords, cast, and crew.
Cosine Similarity Algorithm: Calculates the similarity between movies using cosine similarity on the feature vectors.
User-Friendly Interface: Input a movie title, and Cinephile returns a list of similar movies.
Scalable: Capable of handling many movies and providing fast recommendations.

How It Works

Data Preprocessing: The movie metadata is cleaned and preprocessed to extract relevant features like genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overview (plot summary).
Feature Vectorization: The text-based features are transformed into vector representations using techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
Cosine Similarity: The cosine similarity between the movie vectors is computed to identify the most similar movies to the user's input.
Recommendation: Based on the cosine similarity scores, the top N most similar movies are returned as recommendations.
